          <h2>15-MAN SQUAD</h2>
          You must pick a squad of 15 players. The squad must consist of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>2 goalkeepers</li>
            <li>5 defenders</li>
            <li>5 midfielders</li>
            <li>3 attackers</li>
          </ul>
          The total value of the squad cannot exceed the budget, which is set to 1000M by default.<br/>
          You can always go back and make changes to your squad until the submission deadline (five minutes before kick-off of the first fixture of the game).<br/><br/>

          <h2>STARTING ELEVEN</h2>
          You must pick a starting eleven from the players in your squad. The following rules apply for the starting eleven:
          <ul>
            <li>1 goalkeeper</li>
            <li>Between 3 and 5 defenders</li>
            <li>Between 3 and 5 midfielders</li>
            <li>Between 1 and 3 attackers</li>
          </ul><br/>

        <section class="border-top">
          <h2>SUBSTITUTES</h2>
          The four remaining players in your squad have to be placed on the substitutes bench.
          These players will be subject to automatic substitutions after the contest or gameweek has ended.
          The substitutes will be called upon if any players in your starting eleven do not play a single minute.<br/>
          The outfield player substitutes must be prioritised for automatic substitutions.
          If the first substitute does not play, or the substitution will lead to an invalid formation, the next in line will be used instead.<br/><br/>

          This player receives double points.
          You must also select a vice-captain, which will replace your selected captain if he doesn’t play.<br/><br/>

          <h2>SPREAD BETTING SCHOOL</h2>
          Placing your first Spread Bet is possibly the most exciting bet you’ll ever place!
          For some, it’s a daunting prospect but we’re here to explain how to bet on a spread and enjoy it!<br/>
          As explained above, for your first bet we recommend using smaller stakes and picking a low volatility market – that is, a market where the most likely outcomes are not going to be too far from the ‘Sell’ and ‘Buy’ prices.
          We’d also recommend that you pick a market that allows you to work out the worst case scenario.<br/><br/>
          For example:<br/>
          Total Goals in a football match may be priced at 2.8-3.0 and so the worst-case scenario if you place a ‘Buy’ bet is a loss of three times your stake because the lowest possible outcome is a settle price of 0 goals in a match that finishes 0-0.
          Here, if you had placed a ‘Buy’ bet with a stake of €5 per point the worst-case scenario is a €15 loss, calculated as:<br/><br/>
          (Settled Price – Buy Price) x Stake<br/>
          (0 – 3) x €5<br/>
          -3 x €5 = €15 Loss<br/><br/>
          Of course, it follows that if the game is a 3-3 thriller then the market would settle at six and the profit would be calculated as:<br/><br/>
          (Settled Price – Buy Price) x Stake<br/>
          (6 – 3) x €5<br/>
          3 x €5 = €15 Profit
