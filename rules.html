      <h2>MANAGING YOUR TEAM</h2>
      <h4>15-MAN SQUAD</h4>
      You must pick a squad of 15 players. The squad must consist of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>2 goalkeepers</li>
        <li>5 defenders</li>
        <li>5 midfielders</li>
        <li>3 attackers</li>
      </ul>
      The total value of the squad cannot exceed the budget, which is set to 500M by default.<br/>
      You can always go back and make changes to your squad until the submission deadline (five minutes before kick-off of the first fixture of the game).<br/><br/>

      <h4>STARTING ELEVEN</h4>
      You must pick a starting eleven from the players in your squad. The following rules apply for the starting eleven:
      <ul>
        <li>1 goalkeeper</li>
        <li>Between 3 and 5 defenders</li>
        <li>Between 3 and 5 midfielders</li>
        <li>Between 1 and 3 attackers</li>
      </ul><br/>
      <h4>SUBSTITUTES</h4>
      The four remaining players in your squad have to be placed on the substitutes bench.
      These players will be subject to automatic substitutions after the contest or gameweek has ended.
      The substitutes will be called upon if any players in your starting eleven do not play a single minute.<br/>
      The outfield player substitutes must be prioritised for automatic substitutions.
      If the first substitute does not play, or the substitution will lead to an invalid formation, the next in line will be used instead.<br/><br/>

      <h4>CAPTAIN</h4>
      You must also select a captain.
      This player receives double points.
      You must also select a vice-captain, which will replace your selected captain if he doesnâ€™t play.<br/><br/>

      <h4>RESTRICTIONS</h4>
      For all games with more than 2 matches, you cannot select more than a total of three players from the same team.
      For contests with 2 matches, the maximum number of players from the same team is 5.<br/>
      For games with only 1 match, you can select an unlimited number of players from any team.

      <h4>TRANSFERS</h4>
      Some games allow you to make player transfers between rounds.
      The rules for transfers are explained on the game information page of these games.<br/><br/>

      <h4>WILDCARDS</h4>
      Some season long games will allow the use of a wildcard during specified periods.
      The rules for wildcards are explained on the game information page of these games.<br/><br/>
